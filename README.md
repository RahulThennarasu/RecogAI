# Image Classifier Web App

## Overview

Welcome to the Image Classifier Web App project! This ongoing initiative is aimed at developing a user-friendly web application that leverages image classification technology. The primary objective is to empower users to upload images and receive accurate predictions about the content of those images. Currently, the project is in the early stages of development, with a basic setup for classifying general images using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. Please be aware that the project is not yet finished and is actively being enhanced.

## Features

1. **Image Classification**
   - Users can upload a variety of images, and the application will provide predictions about the content based on the MobileNetV2 model. This functionality serves as the foundation for the broader image classification capabilities we aim to offer.

2. **Face Detection (Under Development)**
   - We are in the process of integrating face recognition functionality using the `face-api.js` library. This enhancement will enable the system to detect and analyze faces within uploaded images, opening up possibilities for more specialized applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

/image_classifier
|-- static
| |-- js
| | |-- script.js
|-- templates
| |-- index.html
|-- app.py


- **static:** Contains static files, including JavaScript for the frontend.
- **templates:** HTML templates used by Flask.
- **app.py:** The main Flask application file.

## Installation

Getting started with the Image Classifier Web App is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git
   
### Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
